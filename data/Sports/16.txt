Dear Students and Scholars,
The Sports Complex membership for Badminton is in high demand, even after the slots are over some students are requesting for the slots and some of them paid the fee for the same. With the concurrence from Prof. in Charge Sports and Dean Students Affair, it is planned to allow the alternate day slots system for badminton from 9th Jan 2023 - Monday onwards. 
Batch 1 - Existing members (those who paid and got slots) will access the badminton court on Monday, Wednesday and Friday only.
Batch 2 - Others (Those who paid but not got slots and yet to pay for badminton court) will access the court on Tuesday, Thursday and saturday only. 
The students who paid for badminton courts are asked to book their slots before 6th Jan 2023 by 5.00 PM.   If anyone wants to pay for badminton, they can pay a fee and get a slot before the due date (6th Jan 2023). 
We request your cooperation in this regard.
Please note: 
The late payment will not be accepted. 
Don't pay the fee without checking the slots availability. 
For Checking the slot availability, pls come to Admin Sports Office between 9.00 to 1.00 PM and 2.00 to 5.00 PM. Please don't come during Lunch time (1.00 PM to 2.00 PM)

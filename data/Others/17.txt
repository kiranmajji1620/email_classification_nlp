Dear Sir/Madam,

Our institute's water sources are exhausted in nature and unable to get sufficient water from those. 

From 03.11.2023 onwards, the institute is procuring the water through outside water tanker lorries based on the day to day requirement. 

In view of the above, it is requested to use the water judicially/Minimally.  Same may be communicated to all the occupants/students.

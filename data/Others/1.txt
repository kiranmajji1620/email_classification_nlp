Greetings!

The B.Tech 2022 batch people(1st years) can shift to their new allotted rooms in Ashoka along with their luggage. But before shifting do make sure that the rooms allotted to you all in Ashoka are vacant. In case the rooms are being locked by students of B.Tech 2021 batch people then those specific set of first years can keep their luggage in the storage rooms of Ashoka Hostel.

Other batch students of DD19 Batch (5th Year), BTech 2020 (4th Year), BTech 2021(3rd year), M.Tech 2022, and MDes can shift to their new allotted rooms if at all they are vacant, anytime before the college reopens.

In case of any queries please contact the Hostel Affairs Team or the Hostel Caretakers.
Thanking you,
Regards,
Hostel Affairs Team

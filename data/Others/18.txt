Dear Students,

Hope this email finds you well. We are writing to inform you about an important matter concerning the well-being of everyone in regard to the recent incident of a snake entering into one of the water coolers.  

The hostel office team has scheduled an ongoing pest control treatment that will cover the major buildings including academics, laboratory, pems blocks, hostel zones and admin.

Requesting your cooperation and adherence to any instructions provided by the pest control team or institute staff.

Thanks and regards,

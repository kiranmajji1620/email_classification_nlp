Dear Students (boys),

It has been noticed that most of the students are not locking their rooms while being away for longer periods of time. This is to urge all the students to lock their rooms without fail. The institute shall not be responsible for any losses/thefts taking place when the room is left unlocked.

It has also been noticed that those who go home on leave/internship do not lock their rooms. This is a serious violation of hostel regulations regarding safety and security. Such violations will draw severe penalties.

CCTV cameras are not substitutes for the locks to your rooms.

Best regards,
WARDENS

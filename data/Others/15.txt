Dear students,
We hope this email finds you well. We are writing to address the ongoing lane issues in the Ashwatha hostel. The hostel affairs team is actively working to resolve the lan issues as swiftly as possible. However, we must inform you that it may take a few more days to completely rectify the situation.

In the meantime, we want to bring to your attention an essential matter. It has come to our notice that some students may have attempted to address the network equipment on their own, which could be the underlying cause of the issues we are facing. We kindly request that you refrain from doing so in the future.

Touching or tampering with the network equipment without proper knowledge and authorization can lead to further complications and might affect not only your connectivity but also that of your fellow hostel mates. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Hostel Affairs Team
IIITDM Kancheepuram

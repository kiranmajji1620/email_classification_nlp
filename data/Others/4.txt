Dear students,

In addition to the points mentioned in the trailing mail.

Housekeeping staff are generally available during the day time (8.30 AM to 5 PM). If it rains during that time, they clean the water from time to time from all floors and stairs. However, if it rains during the night time, the water stagnates on the stairs and some of the floors. Hence, the hostel inmates should be careful during that period. Do not venture out of your room during the night time on rainy days. If you want to use the washroom, carefully check the floors and avoid the water.

Regards,
Wardens

Dear all, 

We have taken up the Wi-Fi issues with the networking team, the MAC address system have begun. A separate g-form shall be circulated for the Wi-Fi MAC address collection in another 4-5 days, until then laptops for which the Ethernet MAC address are given shall work via Ethernet and if you have issues on connecting your phone via Wi-Fi, please ensure that the random ip generated in Android devices or Private Wi-Fi address on IoS devices is switched off.

Since there is a transition cooperation is solicited from all. 

Regards, 
Technical Affairs Team.

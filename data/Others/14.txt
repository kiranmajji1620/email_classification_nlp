Greetings!

On few floors of Ashoka LAN connection is disrupted since the last two days. 

The issue will be resolved within few days as the wires providing the connection have been broken.

Considering the quiz schedule of students we will try to come up with a wifi connection temporarily for these floors and the update regarding the same will be given by tomorrow morning.

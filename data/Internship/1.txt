Greetings from GDSC,
I hope everyone is enjoying their vacation to the fullest. An important announcement. Google is again back with its STEP Intern program for students who are currently studying in their 2nd year of graduation.
Google is invested in increasing the number of future computer scientists and software developers, particularly those who are historically underrepresented in the field. Many aspiring computer scientists could benefit from a program that bridges the gap between academic study and a professional internship. With such a program, Google aims to inspire these underrepresented students to continue in the field.

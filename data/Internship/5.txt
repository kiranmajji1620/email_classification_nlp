Dear Binsu,

I hope this email finds you well. We have a good experience with the current batch of interns from IIITDM.

As their term is concluding, we are keen to continue this collaboration. We propose sending a new batch of interns (7th or 8th sem ) for a duration of atleast 6 months to our lab to further contribute to ongoing research projects, specifically in the fields of VLSI and Machine Learning. 
Please circulate this message among your colleagues and students of the Electronics and Computer science departments.

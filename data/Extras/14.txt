Greetings from The Cinematics Club !! ðŸ«¡


Whenever we watch a movie, we often think of ourselves as the main character in the film. Now this is your chance to be that. This Meraki, Cinematics Club is here with the event - Picture Parody, where you can remake/reenact a scene from their favorite movie and share it with us! ðŸ˜„

Wait a minute, we already took the responses right, so what's left?

Yes, you guessed it right ! It's screening time. Come witness the amazing recreations done by our friends from various movies around the world. ðŸ¤©

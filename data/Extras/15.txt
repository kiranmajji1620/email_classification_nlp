Welcome everyone!!!!!
Drawing is usually something done individually. But that’s no fun isn’t it. 
Come, team up with your friend and show us how you cross your limits together. Even if it somehow goes bad you can always blame each other because that what good teammates do.
I’ll give you a little hint of what you guys are in for. The drawings going to be a bit of both of you, but not together. 
So, why not join us during Meraki and partake in some chaos.
So get ready for the contest. We have a prize pool of 1.7k!!

Dear All,

A few months ago, Alumni Affairs hosted a talk with Prajali Parse, our Alumna - a Data Scientist at Autodesk, and a masters-graduate of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranjali-ajay-parse

Please find the below message from her.

Hello,
I hope you're doing well! :)
I am Pranjali Ajay Parse, a IIIT alumni. I had hosted a session on Data Science as one of the alumni affairs sessions a few months back. I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Autodesk, and completed my masters from University of Massachusetts, Amherst recently. In these tough recession times, I wanted to reach out to the alumni affairs team and help the current students in every way possible. 
I was hoping that you could communicate this to the IIIT students that I am willing to provide referrals to 15 students for all types of internships and full time roles at Autodesk, provide resume reviews & cover letter reviews, and some career advice sessions. All they'd have to do is connect with me or DM me on LinkedIn and I have provided my LinkedIn profile link below:

Please let me know if you have any questions and it'd be great if you could pass on this information. Hoping to hear soon :)
Thanking you,
Regards
Pranjali Ajay Parse

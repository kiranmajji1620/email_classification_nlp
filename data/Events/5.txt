Greetings from CS Club



We hope you’re doing well and you’re excited for what we have planned next! EdITH is back again with another session on Android App Development with Kotlin.



This is a great opportunity to learn the fundamentals of Kotlin and how to use Android Studio to build a basic app. You will also be provided with additional resources to kickstart your android development journey! 



The prerequisites are to have Android Studio installed (spoiler alert: it’s quite a large file). Also bring a fully charged laptop.



We would be thrilled if you go through this short introductory video on Kotlin as well. It would be immensely helpful.
